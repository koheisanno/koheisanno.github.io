            What is the SAS Service Portal?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The SAS Service Portal is an online management system that allows members of the service community to record and track service hours, events, meetings, and activities hosted by our numerous service clubs and projects.
            <br><br>
            This tutorial will cover the essentials to get you started on your service journey at SAS.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The SAS Service Portal is only available on Google Chrome provided it is connected to your SAS Gmail account. It will not work on Safari, Opera, or any other internet browsers.
            <br>
            <br>

            Step 1. Explore and Join Clubs
        </h4>
        <p>
            If you are a new member of the community, you might want to take a look at all of the opportunities this community has to offer. In addition to the service fair and the service assembly, you can further explore our clubs on the portal.
            <br>
            <br>
            To find all of our clubs, <strong>simply click on the Join Clubs button</strong>.
            <br>
            <img src='image1.PNG'>
            <br>
            There, you can read through the mission statement of each club, with the option of joining by clicking on the <strong>Join</strong> button.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, you can take the <strong>Club Quiz</strong> for a more interactive approach to exploring our clubs.

            <br>
            <br>
            On the left hand side, you can choose your preferences with regards to club size, focus region, area of service, and type of work. The best matches for your indicated preferences will pop up on the table on the right!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4 id='three'>
            Step 2. Check into meetings and events
        </h4>
        <p>
            Once you have joined clubs, you would want to ensure that your service is recorded on the portal. In order to keep a record of your service, you must <strong>check-in</strong> whenever you attend a service-related event or meeting.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are two ways to check-in.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1. QR Code</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            At the beginning of each event or meeting, the club officers should show a QR Code on a screen. Simply scan the QR Code to check in. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Note: You must use Google Chrome as your browser.</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>2. Manual Check-in</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            During the activity, go on the <strong>Events</strong> page. Click on the icon next to the name to check-in.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h4 id='four'>
            Step 3. Request Hours
        </h4>
        <p>
            Say you attended a meeting and forgot to check-in, or completed a service-related task or activity that is not associated with any particular activity. In this case, you can <strong>request hours</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            To request hours, go on the Service Log page, and click on the <strong>Request Hours</strong> tab.
            <br>
            <br>
            For late check-ins, select the event from the dropdown menu under <strong>Event Name</strong>, and simply click on <strong>check-in</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            For miscellaneous activities or tasks, select <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>, choose the club to which you wish to submit your request, specify the time and the duration, then click on <strong>check-in</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The request may be approved or denied by the club officers.
        </p>
