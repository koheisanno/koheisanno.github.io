            General Recommendations
        </h2>
        <p>
            We recommend that at least one officer or sponsor be in charge of managing the SAS Service Portal, whether it be creating events or handling late check-ins and miscellaneous logs.
            <br><br>
            When you have any questions about the portal, please consult this resource or the FAQ page. If neither of these documents help you, please contact hsservice@sas.edu.sg and we will be happy to assist you!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The SAS Service Portal is only available on Google Chrome provided it is connected to your SAS Gmail account. It will not work on Safari, Opera, or any other internet browsers.

            1.  QR Codes
        </h4>
        <p>
            QR Codes is how we allow members of the service community to join clubs and check into club events. You will find the QR Codes in your <strong>Officer/Sponsor Dashboard</strong> under the QR Codes tab. Select the option you would like depending on whether you want people to <strong>join</strong> your club or you want your members to <strong>check-in</strong>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Check-ins</strong> only work within the 15 minute window before and after the event (i.e. if a meeting starts at 11:30 and ends at 12:00, members may check-in anytime from 11:15 to 12:15).
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src='image1.png' class='img100'>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The url of the join and check-in QR Codes are as follows:
            <br>
            <strong>- Join:</strong> sasserviceportal.com/join/?CLUB_NAME
            <br>
            <strong>- Check-in:</strong> sasserviceportal.com/checkin/?CLUB_NAME
            <br>
            Where CLUB_NAME is the official club name with underscore “_” instead of space  “ “.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4 id='three'>
            2. Creating Events
        </h4>
        <p>
            For every meeting or service activity, you should create an event. Create an event on the Dashboard under the <strong>Manage Events</strong> tab.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src='image2.png' class='img100'>
            <br>
            <br>
            Then, specify the name, the start time, the end time, the location, the type, and whether this event is a meeting. <strong>All meetings count for 0 service hours</strong>.
            <br>
            <img src='image3.png' class='img50'>
            <br>
            <br>
            Once the event has been created, it should be reflected under the <strong>Manage Events</strong> Tab, as well as under the <strong>Events</strong> page.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h4 id='four'>
            3. Managing Member Hours
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are two ways of seeing, changing, and managing your members’ hours.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1. Attendees Page</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Under the <strong>Manage Events</strong> tab inside the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, you will find an <strong>Attendees</strong> button next to each event. Click on the button to access the <strong>Attendees</strong> page, where you will find a list of all of the members with a checkbox to indicate their attendance.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src='image4.png' class='img100'>
            <br>
            <strong>2. Members Page</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Under the <strong>Manage Members</strong> tab inside the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, you will find a <strong>Manage Hours</strong> button next to each event. Click on the button to access the <strong>Member</strong> page, where you will find total hours logged and a list of all attended events. You may also <strong>Add Hours</strong> by retroactively checking the member into an event, or creating a miscellaneous log.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src='image5.png' class='img50'>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h4 id='five'>
            4. Late Check-ins and Miscellaneous Logs
        </h4>
        <p>
            Say a member attended a meeting and forgot to check-in, or completed a service-related task or activity that is not associated with any particular event. In this case, they may request a <strong>Late Check-in</strong> or a <strong>Miscellaneous Log</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Members may submit a miscellaneous log on the Service Log. They will appear under your <strong>Tasks</strong> tab in the <strong>Dashboard</strong>. You may approve, postpone, or deny this request.
            <br>
            <br>
            Similarly, members may also check into a past event on the <strong>Service Log</strong>; you may approve, postpone, or deny this request under the <strong>Tasks</strong> tab.
            <br>
            <br>
            You will also find all miscellaneous logs under the <strong>Miscellaneous Logs</strong> tab.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src='image6.png' class='img100'>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h4 id='six'>
            5. Club Settings
        </h4>
        <p>
            Under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, you can update the following:
            <br>
            1. Club Mission
            <br>
            2. Club Officers and Sponsors
            <br>
            3. Club Colors
            <br>
            <br>
            The Club Mission and Club Colors are important to the way your club will be represented on the portal, as your Club Colors will be used for the <strong>Club</strong> page and the <strong>Events</strong> page, and your Club Mission will be used in the <strong>Club</strong> page.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src='image7.png' class='img100'>
            <br>
            When removing or adding offices or sponsors, please ensure that you have the approval of ESC to go ahead with these actions.
        </p>
        <h4 id='seven'>
            5. Hours Spreadsheet
        </h4>
        <p>
            We understand that some of you prefer to work with spreadsheets instead of with the portal. This year, we are offering the option to use spreadsheets to log attendance on <strong>a per event basis</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            To make a spreadsheet, simply make a copy of <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sTb9-V8-cJJrYF3wn0Ga0zMKgj700YUZozPwxaMbdAA/edit#gid=0' targe='_blank'>this document</a>. This spreadsheet will be used to record hours and attendance for a single event.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src='image8.png' class='img50'>
            <br>
            <br>
            To use this spreadsheet:
            <br>
            1. Fill out all of the details on the <strong>Event Details</strong> tab. Make sure to follow the formatting rules outlined in the third column.
            <br>
            2. Note down all attendees by email on the <strong>Attendees</strong> tab. The hours will fill in automatically, but you may manually change the hours.
            <br>
            3. On the service portal, head over to the <strong>Upload Spreadsheet</strong> tab on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>. Paste in the url for the spreadsheet and click on upload.
